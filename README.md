The last two figures are personal turtle figures.

The first one, I call it “Shrunken-Pentagon”. Because It can draw a stack of continuously expanding hexagons based on the value entered by the user.

The second one is “Chain-Circle”. It can draw a series of circular circles, which look like a chain. The “order”value entered by the user will be used as the number of circles. The “length” value inputed will be used as the radius of circles.

	▪	Explaination and Usage:
“Choose Screen Color”: set the screen colour.

“Pen Speed”: “0”-the fastest;
             “1”-“10”: the speed is gradually increasing.
             
“Pen Width”: The larger the value, the thicker the pen.

“Reset”: Reset the value in the “Preset Frame”.

“Confirm”: After users set the custom pen speed and thickness, click it.

This application allows users to personalize the color of the pen and the screen, as well as the speed and thickness of the brush. It can meet the different aesthetic and painting needs of users, and is more personalized. When the pen speed is slow, users can try to change the color and thickness of the pen or the type of figures. It can create a unique figure.
